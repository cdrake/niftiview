## About

This is my personal rewrite of our official [nifti image viewer](https://github.com/niivue/niivue). 
A lot of the code here has been written by [Taylor Hanayik](https://github.com/hanayik) and [Chris Rorden](https://github.com/neurolabusc). This repo is for my personal experiments.

## Acknowledgements
Chris Rorden has taught me most of what I know about volume rendering. Taylor Hanayik has judiciously ensured we have a robust development process.
